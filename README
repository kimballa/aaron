This contains my vimrc, bashrc, and a bunch of handy
scripts.  For best results, put aaron.git/bin in your $PATH.

Running the 'deploy-etc' script will rewrite .bashrc and
.vimrc to point to the files in etc/ in this directory
(after backing them up, of course!).

Machine-specific bashrc elements go in ~/.localbashrc.

This is most useful in conjunction with my 'vimscripts'
repo, which contains the rest of the vim plugins and etc.
that I use.

### Renamed branch

The branch was renamed from `master` to `main` in 2025. For 
deployments that have not yet updated, follow these steps:

```bash
# Switch to the "master" branch (if not already there):
$ git checkout master

# Rename it to "main":
$ git branch -m master main

# Get the latest commits (and branches!) from the remote:
$ git fetch

# Remove the existing tracking connection with "origin/master":
$ git branch --unset-upstream

# Create a new tracking connection with the new "origin/main" branch:
$ git branch -u origin/main
```
