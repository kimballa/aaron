This contains my vimrc, bashrc, and a bunch of handy
scripts.  For best results, put aaron.git/bin in your $PATH.

Running the 'deploy-etc' script will rewrite .bashrc and
.vimrc to point to the files in etc/ in this directory
(after backing them up, of course!).

Machine-specific bashrc elements go in ~/.localbashrc.

This is most useful in conjunction with my 'vimscripts'
repo, which contains the rest of the vim plugins and etc.
that I use.
